Demo of Robolectric.

As Android studio sometimes forgets the module sources, it is necessary to ensure that
the correct folders are used. 
If using OSX, press cmd + return -> Modules -> Fagkveld. Then choose sources, and do the following:

- Set the src/main/java folder to be the source folder
- Set the src/test/java folder to be the test source folder
